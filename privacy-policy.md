# LinkSeek Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]  
**Version:** 1.0

## Introduction

LinkSeek ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use LinkSeek.

## Information We Collect

### Data Collected for Core Functionality

**Search Terms**: When you use LinkSeek to search for words on web pages, we temporarily process your search terms to perform the search functionality. These terms are not stored or retained after your search session ends.

**Page Content**: To provide search results, LinkSeek temporarily accesses the text content of the current webpage you're viewing. This content is processed locally within your browser and is not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

**User Preferences**: LinkSeek stores your preference for the Ctrl+F keyboard shortcut binding locally in your browser. This setting is stored using Chrome's storage API and remains on your device.

**Search Interactions**: We detect when you click the search button or use the Ctrl+F shortcut to trigger the search functionality. This interaction data is used solely to activate the search feature.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal identifying information (names, email addresses, etc.)
- Browsing history or web page visit data
- Location information
- Financial or payment information
